INSTALL FONTS

If you’d like to install all the fonts in the font pack at once, follow these instructions:

	IN WINDOWS

    To search and find all of the TTF  (True Type Font) files in the unzipped directory of fonts, use CTRL-F
    type *.ttf (asterisk dot ttf) as your search keyword.
    The search will list all of the fonts in their separate directories.
    To select all of them at once use CTRL-A. (Alternately you can click edit on the windows toolbar and select, “select all”.)
    Then right-click on any of the highlighted fonts and select “install font”. (Make sure to right-click rather than left-click, otherwise you won’t see the install font option and you’ll have to select them all again using CTRL-A.)
	Repeat these instructions for *.otf (Open Type) fonts
