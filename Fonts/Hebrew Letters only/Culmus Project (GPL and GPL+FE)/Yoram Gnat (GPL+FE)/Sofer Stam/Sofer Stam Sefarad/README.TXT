The next 2 fonts, although not really ancient, are based on ancient fonts
in the package and therefore I decided to add them to it as well.
  
18. Makabi YG                   Based on Isaiah scroll but modernized
19. Keter YG (4 weights)        Based on Aleppo Codex but modernized


The basic Canaanite alphabet consisted of 22 signs representing
consonants (in some languages like Ugarit up to 27 signs). 
The names of the signs are/were very similar to the still
used names of Hebrew letters.

All the fonts contain the glyphs in the Hebrew Unicode code range (0590-05FF).
Starting with Unicode standard 5.2, the Phoenician, Imperial Aramaic
and Samaritan languages have their own designated code ranges. 
Therefore, the relevant fonts have the glyphs encoded in their respective
Unicode designated ranges as well.

Fonts 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 9 contain the glyphs in the Phoenician
Unicode range (10900-1091F).

Font 8 contain the glyphs in the Samaritan code range (0800-083F).
Note: This font does not implement Samaritan vowel, punctuation and accent
marks. I hope to implement those in future versions

Fonts 10 and 11 contain the glyphs in the Aramaic Imperial
code range (10840-1085f)

Font  18 include and implement the Hebrew vowel punctuation.
Fonts 16 and 19 implement the full Hebrew punctuation (vowels and
cantillation marks)

Font 1, the Proto Canaanite, is unique since in the inscriptions,
more that one picture form was found that represent a single consonant.
I encoded several of this alternate forms into the font. To access
the alternate forms (when those exist) the following sequences should be used:
While in Hebrew code range:
    "Base letter" + "Dagesh (U+05BC)" will display first alternate form
    "Base letter" + "Rafe (U+05BF)"   will display second alternate form
While in Phoenician code range:
    "Base letter" + "Phoenician number 10 (U+10917)
                                      will display first alternate form
    "Base letter" + "Phoenician number 20 (U+10918)                             
                                      will display second alternate form
 
 
The accompanying documentation is in Hebrew. I hope to provide
English documentation in the future.
