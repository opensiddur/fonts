			Abyssinica SIL is based on Ethiopic calligraphic traditions. This release is a 
			regular typeface, with no bold or italic version available or planned.

			The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font 
			that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
			Ethiopic-based writing system. In addition, there is provision for other 
			Latin characters and symbols. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
			technologies to support the need to position arbitrary combinations of 
			*Ethiopic* base glyphs and combining marks optimally. It also supports
			almost 200 kerning pairs. This version of the font also supports 14 Stylistic
			Sets (OpenType) or Features (Graphite) which make glyph alternates available 
			for a number of Ethiopic and punctuation characters. See 
			AbyssinicaSILFontFeatures.pdf for details on applications which support 
			Stylistic Sets and how to access them.

      One font from this typeface family is included in this release:

            * Abyssinica SIL Regular 

			For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.
