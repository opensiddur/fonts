I created the "Shmulik CLM" font in memory of 
Shmulik Katz (August 18, 1926 - March 26, 2010), 
the Israeli artist, ilustrator and cartoonist. This font
is inspired by the letter forms of his hand drawn "Passover Hagadah"
for the Kibutzim. (see http://www.zchor.org/pesach/pesach.html)

The fontforge sources are in the SFD folder. The fonts
themselves, in .ttf format, are in the TTF folders.

"Shmulik CLM" fully supports Hebrew niqud (vowel marks,
shin dots, dagesh, rafe and meteg) positioning. Cantillation
marks (Teamim) were made transparent, thus text including
them should still be displayed with proper positioning of the
niqud.

The Samples folder includes the following files 
Shmulik_With_Vowels.pdf - Shows combinations of vowels with the letters
HaLahma-orig.jpg       - A picture of a page from Shmuel Katz Hagada
Ha-Lahma-Rambam.pdf    - The "Ha Lahma Anyia" text written with
                         "Shmulik CLM" font. The wording taken from Maimonides
                         version of the Hagada
Sample.pdf             - Just another sample of the font
