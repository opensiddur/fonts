"Keter Aram Tsova" font is based on the letter forms of
the Aleppo Codex from the begining of 10th century CE.
The font supports cantillation marks (Taamim) positioning.
The font includes Latin glyphs (only basic Latin) based
on the "Carolingian Miniscule" letter forms used between
800 to 1200CE. The Greek letter in the font are based on the
"Codex Sinaiticus" from the 4th cebtury CE and includes only
uppercase letter forms.

The fontforge sources are in the SFD folder. The fonts
themselves, in .ttf format, are in the TTF folders.

The "Keter Aram Tsova" comes in a single "demi-bo;d" weight.

The Samples folder includes the following files 
test.pdf                     -  Shows some special cases of mark positioning
KeterAramTsova-Devarim28.pdf -  Shows a photo of chapter 28 from the          
                                Book of Deuteronomy from the original codex
                                and a transcription of the same page written
                                in the "Keter Aram Tsova" font

To correctly display text with cantillation marks one should keep the
following typing order:
    Base Letter (consonant)
    Shin/Sin dot
    Dagesh/Rafe
    Niqud (vowel sign)
    Lower cantillation marks
    Upper cantillation marks.

See the file test.pdf for the treatement of meteg (siluq).

Well, like with all rules, there are exception. 
To properely position the lower right marks - yetiv and dehi,
they should be typed before vowel marks, meteg and any other cantillation
marks.

Of course you will need a keyboard map that supports cantillation marks.
The Tiro keyboard available at
http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx
can be used for Windows and OS/X. A keyboard layout based on Tiro
is available in most Linux distributions.
