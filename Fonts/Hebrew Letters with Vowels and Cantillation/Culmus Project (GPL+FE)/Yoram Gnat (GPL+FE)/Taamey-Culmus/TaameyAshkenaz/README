"Taamey Ashkenaz" was inspired by the fonts used to print the Hebrew 
Bible, in Central Europe, at the end of the 19th and beginning of 
the 20th century. Specifically, the beautiful typeface used to print
the BHK (Biblia Hebraica Kittel), edited by Prof. Rudolf Kittel  
trigered the design of the font

The fontforge sources are in the SFD folder. The fonts
themselves, in .ttf format, are in the TTF folder.

This is for now, my only font with all variants supporting the positioning
of Hebrew vowel signs (Niqud) and Cantillation marks (Taamim). This includes
recognition and correct positioning of "Patah Ganuv" (furtive patah) and
positioning of "Holam" before "Alef shoteqet".

In fact, it is the Demi-Bold variant that mostly resembles the early 20th
century Hebrew fonts. I designed the Medium variants to be more
lightweight then the typical type-faces from the printed books.

The Samples folder includes the following files: 

test.pdf                  	-  Shows some special cases of mark positioning

Bereshit-Kittel_and_Ashkenaz.pdf-  This file includes a photo from a 1905
				   edition of the BHK. and then the same text
				   (Genesis chapter 1) written with the Medium
				   and the Bold variants of the font.

Tehilim.pdf               	-  Psalms chapter 1 written with the
				   "Medium Oblique" and "Bold Oblique" variants
				   of the font.

To correctly display text with cantillation marks one should keep the following
typing order:

    Base Letter (consonant)
    Shin/Sin dot
    Dagesh/Rafe
    Niqud (vowel sign)
    Lower cantillation marks
    Upper cantillatio marks.

See the file test.pdf for the treatment of meteg (siluq).

Of course you will need a keyboard map that supports cantillation marks.
The Tiro keyboard available at
http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx
can be used for Windows and OS/X. A keyboard layout based on Tiro
is available in most Linux distributions.
