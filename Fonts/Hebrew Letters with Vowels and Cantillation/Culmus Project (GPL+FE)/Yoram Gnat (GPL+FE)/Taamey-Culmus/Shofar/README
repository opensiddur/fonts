Although Shofar" was inspired by the Koren font it has a redesigned
letter forms and height to width ratio. Since the letter forms are based on
ancient, probably Karaitic, Hebrew scripts, I based the design the 
cantillation marks on the ancient forms (like those found in Alleppo
and Leningrad codices).

The fontforge sources are in the SFD folder. The fonts
themselves, in .ttf format, are in the TTF folders.

The "Shofar" Regular and RegularOblique variants supports positioning
of Hebrew vowel signs (Niqud)and Cantillation marks (Taamim). This includes
recognition and correct positioning of "Patah Ganuv" (furtive patah‚Äè) and
corect positioning of "Holam" before "Alef shoteqet". In the Bold
variants the cantillation marks (Taamim) were made transparent, thus text
including them should still be displayed with proper positioning
of the niqud.

The Samples folder includes the following files 
test.pdf                  -  Shows some special cases of mark positioning
Bereshit.pdf              -  Genesis chapter 1 written with the Regular variant.
Tehilim.pdf               -  Psalms chapter 1 written with the RegularOblique
                             variant.

To correctly display text with cantillation marks one should keep the following
typing order:

    Base Letter (consonant)
    Shin/Sin dot
    Dagesh/Rafe
    Niqud (vowel sign)
    Lower cantillation marks
    Upper cantillatio marks.

See the file test.pdf for the treatment of meteg (siluq).

Of course you will need a keyboard map that supports cantillation marks.
The Tiro keyboard available at
http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLHebrew.aspx
can be used for Windows and OS/X. A keyboard layout based on Tiro
is available in most Linux distributions.
