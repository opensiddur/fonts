# Raidho Theodings

Raidho Theodings is a dingbat font with an assortment of European cultural, religious, and magical symbols. There are a wide variety of solar symbols, magical protection signs, symbols of deities, and decorative motifs. Each symbol is provided either in three weights, or in both outlined and solid black versions.

The characters are encoded in the Unicode Private Use area beginning at U+EDDA (decimal 60890, octal 166732).

The circular symbols from U+EE1C through U+EE23 are combining characters. Using automatic kerning effects, most symbols in the font can be inscribed within the combining circles simply by first inserting the combining circle, and then inserting the character to be inscribed within it. In some cases, a full-size baseline-aligned character is too large to fit within the circles, and an alternate smaller form is provided, sized and centered appropriately.

The meandros characters from U+EE71 through U+EE7C use automatic kerning effects to remove the overlap of consecutive meandros characters. Inserting the same character repeatedly will produce a continuous meandros.

Many of these symbols have multiple meanings or connotations. It is important to research the meanings of these symbols before using them, to avoid misunderstanding of your document or illustration. A list of symbol descriptions is provided in the file "character list.txt". The files "character map.pdf" and "character map.png" provide a visual reference to associate the symbols with their assigned Unicode values.

The name of the font is an overlapping play on words, from "theos" (Greek, "a god"), "theod" (Anglo-Saxon, "people, folk"), "Odin" (Old Norse, "the god Wo√∞anaz"), "ding" (pan-Germanic, "thing, object", "assembly, gathering"), and "Ing" (proto-Germanic, "a god", "the god Ingwaz/Frawjaz").
